Blackwater’s 1st Red Squadron was created to meet the operational needs of the U.S. Department of Defense in military and non-military operations. 1st Red Squadron was the original ODA unit within Blackwater’s first international security group. The first detachment commander of 1st Red Squadron, DC9L (AG) Legacy-1, identified the need for a multi-role quick response force with a full time aviation element and explosives unit. Established in 2018, 1st Red Squadron became operational after receiving federal funding for operations in Northern Vietnam. The primary focus of 1st Red Squadron was counter terrorism and drug interdiction. After quickly setting the standard for international paramilitary operations with a high success rate, 1st Red Squadron was given funding for operations in the Pakistan Tribal Mountains where several members of the group were identified for the Central Intelligence Agencies highest civilian award, The Distinguished Intelligence Cross. 1st Red Squadron now operates internationally with U.S. and Coalition forces under DC9C (OD) Sierra-1 with federal funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of State.
